# üíæ Installation
## ü™ü Windows
- [Download](../../releases/latest) either `AUnlocker_v*_Steam_Itch.zip` or `AUnlocker_v*_EpicGames_MicrosoftStore_XboxApp.zip` depending on your edition of Among Us.
- Extract the contents of the zip into your Among Us folder. You can find your Among Us folder like this:
  - **Steam:** Right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Manage` ‚Üí `Browse local files`
  - **Epic Games:** Right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Manage` ‚Üí click the small folder icon next to `Installation`
  - **Itch.io:** Open the Itch.io app ‚Üí Right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Manage` ‚Üí `Open folder in Explorer`.
  - **Xbox App:** Open the Xbox app ‚Üí Right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Manage` ‚Üí `Files` ‚Üí `Browse...`
  - **Microsoft Store:** Check [this support article](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/where-can-i-find-the-gamefiles-of-a-game/5cb9a0c3-7948-4316-abc5-f27d1767b932) on how to find and access your Among Us folder.
- Your game folder should look like this after installation:
<img src="https://github.com/astra1dev/AUnlocker/assets/90265231/14226f03-a003-4efc-b27b-6df53fb394d6" width=410 height=240>

- Launch Among Us. The first launch will take **MUCH** longer, so don't worry if you have to wait a few minutes.

## üêß Linux
- Make sure you are running Among Us under Proton (or Wine). On Steam you can check this by right-clicking Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Properties` ‚Üí `Compatibility` ‚Üí `Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool`. Test different Proton versions if you're having issues launching the game. 
- Check out [this guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html) to get BepInEx (the framework AUnlocker is built upon) working. Alternatively, if you are using Proton with Steam, you can specify the DLL override in the launch options (right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Properties` ‚Üí `General` ‚Üí `Launch Options`): `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp.dll=n,b" %command%` Then follow the steps for Windows.
- If you are experiencing crashes or errors like `Unable to execute IL2CPP chainloader`, set your launch options (right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Properties` ‚Üí `General` ‚Üí `Launch Options`) to `PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp.dll=n,b" %command%` 

<hr>

<b>üëæ If you are already using other mods or already have BepInEx installed:</b>
- You should see a folder called `BepInEx` inside your Among Us folder. 
- Download `AUnlocker_v*.dll` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest), put it into `BepInEx/plugins` and launch Among Us.

<b>üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you don't want to download the pre-compiled DLL, you can build AUnlocker from source by following these steps:</b>
- Make sure you have the [Microsoft .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- Download the necessary files with `git clone https://github.com/astra1dev/AUnlocker`
- Run the command `dotnet build` from the AUnlocker folder (where `AUnlocker.sln` is located)
- The compiled DLL will be located here: `src/bin/Debug/net6.0/AUnlocker.dll`. Put it into `BepInEx/plugins` and launch Among Us.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
AUnlocker does not unlock all cosmetics **permanently**, so it does **not** add them to your account. This is because your progress is stored on the Innersloth servers. If you uninstall this mod, the cosmetics will be locked again. The cosmetics you have already unlocked, e.g. through buying a cosmicube, are **untouched** by this mod.
